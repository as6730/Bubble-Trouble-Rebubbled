# Bubble Trouble: Rebubbled

### Game Overview and Logic

Rebubbled is a clone of the classic Bubble Trouble game, in which the character attempts to destroy all the perilous bubbles by shooting them with a dividing them into smaller components and eventually destroying them all together. If the character is touched by a bubble, the character loses a life (out of three).

### Functionality & MVP  

- [ ] There will be a control modal describing the rules.
- [ ] Destroying bubbles of various sizes by shooting them with a harpoon.
- [ ] Upon contact with the harpoon, the bubble will split into smaller components until completely destroyed.
- [ ] If the main character is touched by a bouncing bubble, the character loses a life.
- [ ] Controls on the bottom of the game's window will allow the user to quit the game.

### Wireframes

Rebubbled will be a single-window game. The user will be able to move left and right with the keyboard's arrows. Pressing on the spacebar will allow the user to shoot at the bubbles. The user can only shoot another harpoon after the previous harpoon has hit the top of the game's window.
